PLEASE READ BEFORE PROCEEDING!

This script should be run from a host on the corporate/lab network, such as a CentOS VM running on an HPOC cluster. You may need to 'chmod +x stage_workshop.sh' to run the script.

Alternatively it can be run from a macOS host connected to the VPN. To run this script from macOS first install Homebrew (https://brew.sh) and then run the following:

> brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadwanev/bigboybrew/master/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb

All clusters must be Foundationed prior to Workshop staging. Clusters should be Foundationed according to the AOS/hypervisor versions defined in the Workshop - older or new versions may not function as expected.

It is assumed that Prism 'admin' account, CVM 'nutanix' account, and AHV 'root' account share the same password.

All input files must use the following format:

<Nutanix Cluster #1 IP>|<Cluster #1 Password>
<Nutanix Cluster #2 IP>|<Cluster #2 Password>
...
<Nutanix Cluster #N IP>|<Cluster #N Password>

For example:
10.21.1.37|nx2Tech123!
10.21.7.37|nx2Tech517!
10.21.55.37|nx2Tech666!
